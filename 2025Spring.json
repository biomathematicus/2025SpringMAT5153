        "general_instructions": "As part of a multi-omic pipeline, I need to do transcriptomic analysis using data from two experiments on different species. The goal is to gain insights as to why one species is susceptible to severe infection while the other species is not.\\nI have data acquired and used in the following experiments:\\n\\nExperiment 06: Measures of acute primary infection in Macaca mulatta infected with Plasmodium knowlesi\\nTelemetry devices (DSI, model L11) with blood pressure sensors and electrocardiogram (ECG) leads were surgically implanted in four malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), approximately five years of age. After a resting period of two weeks, physiological data that include activity, temperature, ECG, and blood pressure were continuously collected. Two weeks after activation of the telemetry implant, the macaques were inoculated intravenously with cryopreserved P. knowlesi Malayan strain salivary gland sporozoites, obtained from Anopheles dirus infected with parasites from the Pk1A+ clone and previously tested in E30 for their infectivity of macaques. The sporozoite stocks used were produced, isolated and cryopreserved at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and then stored at Yerkes. After inoculation, the macaques were profiled longitudinally for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed with pathology studies and thus terminal necropsies, which were scheduled at the log phase of the infections or at the peak of parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of complete blood counts, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomics analyses. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at five timepoints for functional genomic, targeted proteomic, targeted metabolomics, and immunological analyses. Physiological data noted above were continuously captured via the implanted telemetry devices. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as 'Experiment 06'. The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the MRMC Office of Research Protection Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO).\\n\\nExperiment 07: Measures of acute primary infection in Macaca fascicularis infected with Plasmodium knowlesi\\nThe E07 cohort was inoculated with freshly dissected P. knowlesi sporozoites on 11/01/16. However, for unexplained reasons blood-stage parasitemias did not occur. Consequently, the E07 cohort was reinoculated with cryopreserved P. knowlesi sporozoites. This inoculation was performed on 1/20/17. Hence 'E07A' refers to samples and results from the failed inoculation from 11/01/16 and 'E07B' refers to samples and results from the successful inoculation on 1/20/17). Telemetry devices (DSI, model L11) with blood pressure sensors and electrocardiogram (ECG) leads were surgically implanted in seven malaria-naive male long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), approximately five years of age. After a resting period of three weeks, the telemetry implants were turned on and physiological data that include activity, temperature, ECG, and blood pressure were continuously collected. After the E07A failed infection using a fresh preparation of salivary gland sporozoites, the implants were deactivated to preserve battery life. Between E07A and E07B, a single rhesus macaque (M. mulatta) was added to the cohort as an infection control with no telemetry implant. At the start of E07B, telemetry implants were reactivated. Ten days after reactivation all animals were inoculated intravenously with cryopreserved P. knowlesi Malayan strain salivary gland sporozoites, obtained from Anopheles dirus infected with parasites from the Pk1A+ clone and previously tested in E30 for their infectivity of macaques. The sporozoite stocks used were produced, isolated and cryopreserved at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and then stored at Yerkes. After inoculation, the macaques were profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed with pathology studies and thus terminal necropsies, which were scheduled at the log phase of the infection, at the peak of parasitemias, at the middle of the chronic phase, or at the end of the follow-up period of 45 days after the inoculation of the sporozoites. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of complete blood counts (CBCs), reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at six time points for functional genomic, targeted proteomic, targeted metabolomics, and immunological analyses. Physiological data noted above were continuously captured via telemetry. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as 'Experiment 07 (E07A and 07B)'. The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the MRMC Office of Research Protection Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO).\\n\\nI have data from GEO repository for both experiments.

Provide brief, one-to-two sentence definitions focused on each term\u2019s role in the body (e.g., \"Transcriptomics studies RNA molecules to see which genes are active in a cell\"). \\n\\nDIRECTIVE 3: When applicable, describe how each term is relevant to Experiments 06 and 07, highlighting potential insights on P. knowlesi infection in macaques. Use simple analogies, to make complex ideas more approachable. Keep explanations concise.\\n\\nDIRECTIVE 4: When providing code, write the full code out with comments. Always make sure that ALL the files that are to be used in the analysis are written in the code you output and not just a subset. Show me how to install the correct libraries and packages.\\n\\nDIRECTIVE 5: Produce LaTeX code. Do not add an introductory paragraph, or explanation. I need to be able to use your putput to plug it directly into a LaTeX document. When producing LaTeX output, do not add the header; start from the \\section tag. Likewise, do nto add the \\end{document} tag. \\n\\nDIRECTIVE 6: In the Harmonization Step, preserve all information. This step is about summarizaiton in natural languange processing. We need to avoid loss of information. Avoid duplication of information. \\n \\n",
